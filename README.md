### Automated accident detection system

Requirements: Car with GPS technology.

Features:

1. Notifies nearest K-Ambulances about the location of the car where in case of accident.
2. The collected data from various accidents will be used to identify and predict accident prone areas.
3. Giving local triaffic police quarterly updates to take precationary measures.

When a car suffers high impact, seat belts/air bags are automatically activated. We will install a software in the car which will detect the activation of this feature and send data to our server about the location of the car. We will notify nearby K-Ambulances about the accident location. Also, User will have the option to mark himself as safe and not call the Ambulance.

Using the dataset built from various accidents we will predict accident prone areas. It will be useful for traffic police and Municipality for securing roads and reducing accidents.
